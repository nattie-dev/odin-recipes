Making a website!
hey, odin

I will make a website using the basics of what I learned from theodinproject.
Upon completion I will have demonstrated that I know how to build a website from scratch.

It is now complete and I understand how html works. Still learning about github--
and how to make ubuntu recognize my github commands and apply my commit messages.
There is a lot of inconsistency with it recognizing such.
